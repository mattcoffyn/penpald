# penpald.com

A web scraper for comparing letterboxd users' watchlists to find matching films.

## About

The site is built with **NextJS** with **cheerio** handling the scraping and **tailwindcss** for styling.

Current state is a rough version with (presumably) bugs and incomplete functionality/aesthetics, but is a work in progress.

## To-Do

- General speed and stability
- Display watchlists incl. highlighting of previously watched films for second level of comparison.
- Ability to add >2 users for group matching.
